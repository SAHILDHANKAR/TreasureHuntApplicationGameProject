# TreasureHuntApplicationGameProject
An application to conduct treasure hunt events with editable puzzles where each puzzle is solved via scanning qr code.


This application uses the Zbar library from GitHub for scanning the QR Codes that will be scattered in this treasure hunt.
Also with shared preferences we are editing the puzzles dyamically and increasing the reusability of the application.

Recommended Additional Features that we are looking for :

1. The code is yet to be optimized and standardized.
2. Looking for much more interactive and interesting UI.
3. Also adding image puzzles instead of String puzzles.
